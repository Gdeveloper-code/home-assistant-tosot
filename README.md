# TOSOT for Home Assistant

TOSOT is an unofficial, community-maintained Home Assistant integration for technology enthusiasts. It signs in through GREE OAuth 2.0 and provides a focused set of air-conditioner controls.

This project uses cloud account access. It is separate from Home Assistant's built-in Gree Climate integration, which uses local polling and may support some TOSOT devices.

## Features

- Discovers residential `ac` and commercial `multiAc` devices.
- Controls power, HVAC mode, target temperature, and fan speed.
- Supports Celsius, Fahrenheit, and model-dependent fractional temperature steps.
- Refreshes on setup, after control commands, or through an explicit user request.
- Renews OAuth tokens when required without background polling.

## Installation

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Add this repository as a custom repository with category **Integration**.
3. Download **TOSOT** and restart Home Assistant.
4. Open **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration** and select **TOSOT**.

## Configuration

Select the account region and enter the TOSOT+ account credentials. The password is used for login and is not stored in the Home Assistant config entry.

## Limitations

- Changes made outside Home Assistant require a manual refresh.
- Only power, mode, target temperature, and fan speed are supported.
- Device capabilities depend on data exposed by the cloud API.

## Support

Report defects through the repository issue tracker. Remove account identifiers, tokens, device identifiers, and location data from logs before attaching them.
