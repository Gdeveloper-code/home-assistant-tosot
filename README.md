TOSOT is an unofficial, community-maintained Home Assistant integration for technology enthusiasts. It connects supported TOSOT+ air conditioners to Home Assistant through the user's TOSOT+ cloud account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is not an official TOSOT product. It depends on a cloud service that may change or become unavailable.

## Supported Controls

| Capability | Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Power | Yes | Turn the air conditioner on or off. |
| HVAC mode | Yes | Available modes depend on the device. |
| Target temperature | Yes | Celsius, Fahrenheit, and model-dependent steps. |
| Fan speed | Yes | Available speeds depend on the device. |
| Manual refresh | Yes | No continuous background polling. |

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2026.9.1 or newer.
- A TOSOT+ account with at least one supported air conditioner.
- Internet access from Home Assistant to the cloud service.

## Quick Start

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in the **Integration** category.
3. Download **TOSOT** and restart Home Assistant.
4. Open **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration** and select **TOSOT**.

## Authentication and Configuration

Select the account region, then sign in with the TOSOT+ account associated with the devices. Authentication session data is stored by Home Assistant so the integration can reconnect.

If additional verification is requested, open the sign-in link shown by Home Assistant, complete the challenge in your browser, then paste the complete `http://localhost/...` address from the browser address bar. Do not repeatedly submit the credentials form.

Credentials are submitted only for authentication. Home Assistant stores the resulting session data in the config entry. Never include account details, tokens, device identifiers, or locations in issue reports.

## Refresh Behavior

The integration does not poll continuously. It requests state during setup, after control commands, and when a manual entity update is requested. Changes made outside Home Assistant may not appear until the next refresh.

## Limitations

- Supported controls are limited to power, mode, target temperature, and fan speed.
- Available modes and temperature steps depend on device capabilities.
- Operation depends on the availability and compatibility of the cloud service.

## Support

Report defects through the repository issue tracker. Before attaching diagnostics or logs, remove account identifiers, authentication data, device identifiers, names, and location information.
